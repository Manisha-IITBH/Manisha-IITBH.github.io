I am Manisha Chawla, a Lecturer in Computer Science and an academic researcher working in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Privacy-Preserving Distributed Learning.

I currently serve as a Lecturer at Government Girls Polytechnic Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, where I teach core subjects in Computer Science and actively mentor students in applied and research-oriented learning.

I completed my M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Bhilai in 2024, achieving a CGPA of 10.0. My academic and research work focuses on Federated Learning, Split Learning, personalized learning systems, and trustworthy AI, with applications in medical image analysis and real-world edge deployments.

My research interests lie at the intersection of distributed deep learning, communication-efficient learning, model personalization, and robustness under domain shift. I am particularly interested in developing scalable, privacy-aware learning frameworks suitable for resource-constrained and heterogeneous environments.
